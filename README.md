# Cucumber framework templates

## **STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**

A couple of easy to setup and use templates to test your UI and/or API.

This project is currently built on Ruby version 2.4.1 with the following tools:
- Cucumber
- Capybara
- SitePrism
- MySQL2 <non-relational db support to come>
- Poltergeist (with PhantomJS)
- ChromeDriver
- SeleniumDriver
- *Other browsers to come

It is also following the best practices that I believe make for clear and concise automated tests. These opinions have been discussed and agreed between the collaborators. 

We also have a Gitter community! [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/automating_templates/Lobby.png)](https://gitter.im/automating_templates/Lobby)
